    <h2>My Dearest Shaina,</h2>

    <p>
        If distance had a face, I would argue with it every single day
        for keeping me away from you.
    </p>

    <p>
        Across cities, across silence, across nights where I stare at the ceiling
        wishing you were beside me; my heart still walks toward you.
    </p>

    <p>
        You have this quiet magic about you.
        The way you laugh.
        The way you pretend to be strong.
        The way you care more than you show.
        And somehow, without even trying,
        you became my safest place.
    </p>

    <p>
        You are my calm when my thoughts are loud.
        My warmth when the world feels cold.
        My reason to smile at random moments like an idiot.
    </p>

    <p>
        Loving you doesn’t feel dramatic.
        It feels certain.
        Like sunrise.
        Like breathing.
        Like something my heart decided long before I understood it.
    </p>

    <p>
        And even though miles separate us,
        nothing separates the way I feel about you.
        Not time.
        Not silence.
        Not bad days.
        Not misunderstandings.
    </p>

    <p>
        Because choosing you,
        choosing us,
        is not something I do once.
        I do it every day.
    </p>

    <p>
        And now let me say this properly…
    </p>

    <p>
        You are not just my girlfriend.
        You are my favorite notification.
        My emotional support human.
        My daily happiness subscription.
        My sweet lil penguin 🐧
        who somehow manages to look cute even when being stubborn.
    </p>

    <p>
        You overthink.
        You get dramatic.
        You act like you’re always right.
        (You’re not. But we’ll pretend you are.)
    </p>

    <p>
        And still…
        I wouldn’t change a single thing about you.
        Not your mood swings.
        Not your random anger.
        Not your “I’m fine” when you’re clearly not fine.
    </p>

    <p>
        Because all of that?
        That’s you.
        And I love you, completely, wholeheartedly.
    </p>

    <p>
        So on your birthday,
        I don’t just celebrate the day you were born.
        I celebrate the day the universe decided
        the world needed someone exactly like you.
    </p>

    <p>
        Stay soft.
        Stay strong.
        Stay weird.
        Stay mine.
    </p>

    <p>
        And remember,
        no matter how far we are,
        you will always have someone
        cheering for you,
        loving you,
        and slightly annoying you on purpose.
    </p>

    <p>
        Forever yours,
        the luckiest guy alive.
    </p>
